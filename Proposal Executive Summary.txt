Raytheon Company is in need of a new technology that efficiently pulls data from their machines and allows them to report given parameters in a quick and easy manner.  Their current technology pulls data from their Coating Machines, but the process they have is out dated and performs very slowly. Their current system involves separate applications that run on each individual computer, where the user manually pulls a data file from the machine and runs it through the system after manually entering certain data. Reporting the data in a meaningful way can take up to 5 minutes or more just to generate one report.

With our new implementation, we hope to bring them a system that will make the overall process much more user friendly and efficient. We plan on creating a web app in ASP for the new user interface. The application can be accessed by many that are on the network, and will be “listening” on a directory that each machine will output their data to, automatically pulling it in to the system, parsing through the data, and adding it to the database. With our design, Raytheon will be able to continue using our new technology as their systems and/or workflow change over time.

Resources for the project include our team members, Raytheon Sponsor, and various technical resources. The team will meet on a weekly basis, as well as provide weekly status reports to the Raytheon Sponsor. 

The project has been split into three phases for development: Data Collection and Storage, User Interaction, and Analytics and Reporting. Expected completion dates for the three phases, as well as their respective deliverables, range from October 31 to November 21.
